  The script tracks the disk and CPU utilization. The resulting output
  of the script can be piped into gnuplot to generate a graph of disk
  and CPU USE.


general/helloworld.stp - SystemTap "Hello World" Program
keywords: simple

  A basic "Hello World" program implemented in SystemTap script. It
  prints out "hello world" message and then immediately exits.


general/para-callgraph.stp - Callgraph tracing with arguments
keywords: trace callgraph

  Print a timed per-thread callgraph, complete with function parameters
  and return values.  The first parameter names the function probe
  points to trace.  The optional second parameter names the probe
  points for trigger functions, which acts to enable tracing for only
  those functions that occur while the current thread is nested within
  the trigger.


interrupt/scf.stp - Tally Backtraces for Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI)
keywords: interrupt backtrace

  The Linux kernel function smp_call_function causes expensive
  inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). The scf.stp script tallies the

  identify the cause of the expensive IPI. On exit the script prints
  the tallies in descending frequency.

keywords: disk

  Get the status of reading/writing disk every 5 seconds, output top
  ten entries during that period.


io/io_submit.stp - Tally Reschedule Reason During AIO io_submit Call
keywords: io backtrace

  When a reschedule occurs during an AIO io_submit call, accumulate the
  traceback in a histogram. When the script exits prints out a sorted
  list from most common to least common backtrace.


io/ioblktime.stp - Average Time Block IO Requests Spend in Queue 
keywords: io

  The ioblktime.stp script tracks the amount of time that each block IO
  requests spend waiting for completion. The script computes the
  average time waiting time for block IO per device and prints list
  every 10 seconds. In some cases there can be too many oustanding
  block IO operations and the script may exceed the default number of
  MAXMAPENTRIES allowed. In this case the allowed number can be
  increased with "-DMAXMAPENTRIES=10000" option on the stap command
  line.


io/iostats.stp - List Executables Reading and Writing the Most Data
keywords: io profiling

   The iostat.stp script measures the amount of data successfully read
  and written by all the executables on the system.  The output is
  sorted from most greatest sum of bytes read and written by an
  executable to the least. The output contains	the count of operations
  (opens, reads, and writes), the totals and averages for the number of
  bytes read and written.


io/iotime.stp - Trace Time Spent in Read and Write for Files 
keywords: syscall read write time io

  The script watches each open, close, read, and write syscalls on the
  system. For each file the scripts observes opened it accumulates the
  amount of wall clock time spend in read and write operations and the
  number of bytes read and written. When a file is closed the script
  prints out a pair of lines for the file. Both lines begin with a
  timestamp in microseconds, the PID number, and the executable name in
  parenthesese. The first line with the "access" keyword lists the file
  name, the attempted number of bytes for the read and write
  operations. The second line with the "iotime" keyword list the file
  name and the number of microseconds accumulated in the read and write
  syscalls.

  keystrokes, on a per-tty basis.


locks/bkl.stp - Tracing Contention on Big Kernel Lock (BKL)
keywords: locking

  The bkl.stp script can help determine whether the Big Kernel Lock
  (BKL) is causing serialization on a multiprocessor system due to
  excessive contention of the BKL. The bkl.stp script takes one
  argument which is the number of processes waiting for the Big Kernel
  Lock (BKL). When the number of processes waiting for the BKL is
  reached or exceeded, the script will print a time stamp, the number
  of processes waiting for the BKL, the holder of the BKL, and the
  amount of time the BKL was held.

keywords: locking

  The bkl_stats.stp script can indicate which processes have excessive
  waits for the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) and which processes are taking
  the BKL for long periods of time. The bkl_stats.stp script prints
  lists of all the processes that require the BKL. Every five seconds
  two tables are printed out. The first table lists the processes that
  waited for the BKL followed by the number of times that the process
  waited, the minimum time of the wait, the average and the maximum
  time waited. The second table lists has similar information for the
  time spent holding the lock for each of the processes.


memory/kmalloc-top - Show Paths to Kernel Malloc (kmalloc) Invocations
keywords: memory

  The kmalloc-top perl program runs a small systemtap script to collect
  stack traces for each call to the kmalloc function and counts the
  time that each stack trace is observed. When kmalloc-top exits it
  prints out sorted list. The output can be be filtered to print only
  only the first stack traces (-t) stack traces with more a minimum
  counts (-m), or exclude certain stack traces (-e).


memory/numa_faults.stp - Summarize Process Misses across NUMA Nodes
keywords: memory numa

  The numa_faults.stp script tracks the read and write pages faults for
  each process. When the script exits it prints out the total read and
  write pages faults for each process. The script also providea a break
  down of page faults per node for each process. This script is useful
  for determining whether the program has good locality (page faults
  limited to a single node) on a NUMA computer.


memory/pfaults.stp - Generate Log of Major and Minor Page Faults
keywords: memory

  The pfaults.stp script generates a simple log for each major and
  minor page fault that occurs on the system. Each line contains a
  timestamp (in microseconds) when the page fault servicing was
  completed, the pid of the process, the address of the page fault, the
  type of access (read or write), the type of fault (major or minor),
  and the elapsed time for page fault. This log can be examined to
  determine where the page faults are occuring.

keywords: network socket

  The script instrument each of the functions inn the Linux kernel's
  net/socket.c file. The script prints out trace. The first element of

  indicates function entry and	function exit, respectively. The last
  element of the line is the function name.

  and grouped by individual sockets.


process/chng_cpu.stp - Monitor Changes in Processor Executing a Task
keywords: scheduler

  now running the task, the thread state, and a backtrace showing the
  kernel functions that triggered the running of the task on the
  processor.

keywords: process syscall

  The script prints a periodic tabular report about failing system
  calls, by process and by syscall failure.  The first optional
  argument specifies the reporting interval (in seconds, default 5);
  the second optional argument gives a screen height (number of lines
  in the report, default 20).


process/forktracker.stp - Trace Creation of Processes
keywords: process scheduler

  The forktracker.stp script prints out a time-stamped entry showing
  each fork and exec operation on the machine. This can be useful for
  determine what process is creating a flurry of short-lived processes.

  and the process taking the task. Note that the task may or may not be
  executing at the time of the migration.

  The timeout.stp script is based on a blog entry
  (http://udrepper.livejournal.com/19041.html) mentioning a need for a
  tool to help developers find applications that are polling. The
