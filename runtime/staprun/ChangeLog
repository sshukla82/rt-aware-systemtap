	processing.
	(reader_thread): Remove buffer-full warning.

2005-08-03  Martin Hunt  <hunt@redhat.com>
	* librelay.c (init_stp): Change variable name to eliminate shadow warning.

2005-08-03  Martin Hunt  <hunt@redhat.com>
	* librelay.c (open_control_channel): Set the receive buffer
	to 512K, or the max allowed.

	* stpd.c: Remove "-n" subbug option and change "-b" option
	so you can specify buffering in different ways. Add a verbose option.
	Exec the "stp_check" script.

2005-08-01  Frank Ch. Eigler  <fche@redhat.com>

	* librelay.c: Correct fwrite api usage.
	* all: Correct copyright holder name.

	* librelay.h: Get structs and enums from
	../transport/transport_msgs.h  to eliminate duplication.

	* librelay.c (send_request): Retry if send fails.
	(open_relayfs_files): Use fopen() instead of open() for the
	percpu tmpfiles.
	(request_last_buffers): Just send cpu number for STP_BUF_INFO request.
	(reader_thread): Ditto.
	(process_subbufs): Use fwrite_unlocked() instead of write().
	(sigchld): Removed.
	(init_stp): Go back to using system() instead of fork and exec
	to load module. When done, send a TRANSPORT_INFO request.

	indicate if the module needs removing.
	(sigproc): Remove complicated logic and just send STP_EXIT.
	(stp_main_loop): When receiving STP_TRANSPORT_INFO, set
	the local params and reply with a STP_START.  When
	receiving STP_START, there was an error, so cleanup and exit.

	* stpd.c (main): Added new options to set number of
	buffers and their size.

2005-07-29  Roland McGrath  <roland@redhat.com>

	* librelay.c (process_subbufs): Use unsigned for I.

2005-07-08  Martin Hunt  <hunt@redhat.com>

	* librelay.c (sigchld): Signal handler to detect
	completion of module loading.
	(init_stp): Use fork/exec instead of system() so
	we can get async signal of module load success/failure.
	(cleanup_and_exit): New function.
	(sigproc): If module is not loaded, don't send message to it.
	(stp_main_loop): Call cleanup_and_exit() when STP_EXIT
	is received. Don't send a request for the transport
	mode. The module will send notification to the daemon
	when it is ready.

	* stpd.c (main): Don't print message until module
	is loaded.

2005-07-01  Martin Hunt  <hunt@redhat.com>

	* librelay.c: Large refactoring, important changes are
	added transport_mode command, for relayfs transport
	display results only when probe completes and/or write
	output file, merge, sort and delete the per-cpu files
	in postprocessing, refactor so that relayfs files aren't
	created until transport command received, removed sigalrm,
	read the final subbuffers on exit

	* stpd.c: Remove all command-line args except for -p
	and -q as well as all code related to buffer sizes.
