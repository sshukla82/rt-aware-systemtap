TAPSET DEVELOPER'S GUIDE
------------------------

Tapsets are scripts that encapsulate knowledge about a kernel subsystem
into pre-written probes and functions that can be used by other scripts. 
Tapsets are analogous to libraries for C programs.  They hide the
underlying details of a kernel area while exposing the key information
needed to manage and monitor that aspect of the kernel.  They are typically
developed by kernel subject-matter experts.

This document assumes you are already familiar with SystemTap and the
basics of writing a SystemTap script.  The REFERENCE MATERIAL section
below lists other sources of SystemTap information.  At a minimum, you
should study the SystemTap Tutorial, the HACKING file and some of the
existing tapsets before attempting to write a tapset yourself.


WHAT SHOULD A TAPSET CONTAIN?

A tapset should expose the high-level data and state transitions of a
subsystem. Assume the audience knows little to nothing about the
subsystem's low-level details and probably doesn't care.  Users who need
low-level data typically bypass the tapsets and write custom scripts
targeted to a specific problem.

The first step is to create a simple model of your subject area.  For
example, a model of the process subsystem might include the following:

Key data:

* process ID
* parent process ID
* process group ID

State transitions:

* forked
* execed
* running
* stopped
* terminated

NOTE: This is a simple example and not meant to be a complete list.

Use your subsystem expertise to find probe points (function entries and
exits) that expose the elements of the model, then define probe aliases
for those points.  Be aware that some state transitions can occur in more
than one place. In those cases, an alias can place a probe in multiple
locations.

For example, process execs can occur in either the do_execve() or the
compat_do_execve() functions. The following alias inserts probes at the
beginning of those functions:

probe process.exec = kernel.function("do_execve"),
                     kernel.function("compat_do_execve") {
   < probe body >
}

Try to place probes on stable interfaces whenever possible (i.e., functions
that are unlikely to change at the interface level).  This makes it less
likely that the tapset will break due to changes in the kernel.  Where
kernel version or architecture dependencies are unavoidable, use
preprocessor conditionals (see the stap(1) man page for details).

Fill in the probe bodies with the key data available at the probe points.
Function entry probes can access the entry parameters specified to
the function, while exit probes can access the entry parameters and the
return value.  Convert the data into meaningful forms where appropriate
(e.g., bytes to kilobytes, state values to strings, etc). You may need to
use auxiliary functions to access or convert some of the data. Auxiliary
functions often use embedded C to do things that cannot be done in the
SystemTap language, like access structure fields in some contexts, follow
linked lists, etc. You can use auxiliary functions defined in other tapsets
or write your own.

In the following example, copy_process() returns a pointer to the
task_struct for the new process.  Note that the process ID of the new
process is retrieved by calling task_pid() and passing it the task_struct
pointer. In this case, the auxiliary function is an embedded C function
that's defined in the task tapset (task.stp).

probe process.create = kernel.function("copy_process").return {
   task = $return
   new_pid = task_pid(task)
}

Avoid the temptation to write probes for every function.  Most SystemTap
users won't need or understand them.  Keep your tapset simple and high-
level.


ELEMENTS OF A TAPSET

The following sections describe the most important aspects of writing a
tapset and contributing it to the project.  If you're writing a tapset for
personal use, most of these sections can be ignored, with the exception
of "Tapset files", "Namespace" and "Embedded C & Safety."

Tapset files
------------
Tapset files are stored in src/tapset in the SystemTap GIT directory.  
Most are kept at that level. If you have code that only works on a specific
architecture or kernel-version, you may choose to put that in the
corresponding subdirectories.

Installed tapsets are located in /usr/share/systemtap/tapset/
or /usr/local/share/systemtap/tapset.

Personal tapsets can be stored anywhere, but you must use 
"-I <personal_dir> to specify their location when invoking the stap
command.

Namespace
---------
Probe alias names should take the form <tapset_name>.<probe_name>.  For
example, the probe for sending a signal could be named "signal.send".

Global symbol names (probes, functions and variables) should be unique
across all tapsets.  This helps avoid namespace collisions in scripts
that use multiple tapsets.  To ensure this, use tapset-specific prefixes
in your global symbols.

Internal symbol names should be prefixed with "_".

Comments
--------
All probes and functions should include comment blocks that describe
their purpose, the data they provide and the context in which they run
(e.g., interrupt, process, etc.).  Also use comments in areas where your
intent may not be clear from reading the code.

Documentation
-------------
Every tapset should have its own man page called stapprobes.<tapset>(5).
See src/man for examples.  In addition, the SEE ALSO section in the
stapprobes(5) man page should be updated to refer to your tapset's man
page.

External functions defined in your tapset should be added to the
stapfuncs(5) man page.

Config & Makefiles
------------------
Add your tapset man page to the AC_CONFIG_FILES line in
src/configure.ac, then regenerate the src/configure script by running
autoconf.

Add your tapset man page to dist_man_MANS line in src/Makefile.am, then
regenerate src/Makefile.in by running automake.

Update other Makefiles as necessary.

Test cases
----------
All tapsets should be accompanied by test scripts.  The tests are kept
in src/testsuite in GIT and based on dejagnu.  You must have dejagnu and
expect installed on your system to run the tests.

Your tests should validate that:

- the tapset can be parsed and built
- all probes and functions work as expected
- all potential errors are handled appropriately

See the "test suites" section of the HACKING file and the existing tests
for details.

Example Scripts
---------------
Provide at least one example script that uses the probe aliases and
functions in your tapset.  This serves two purposes.  First, it shows
script writers how you envisioned the tapset being used.  Second, and
most important, it validates that the tapset can actually be used for
something useful.  If you can't write a script that uses the tapset in a
meaningful way, perhaps you should rethink what the tapset provides.

Example scripts are stored in src/examples in GIT.

Change Logs
-----------
Update the appropriate ChangeLog files with a brief description of your
additions and changes.  Note that the change description you enter during
a "cvs commit" does not get added to the ChangeLog files.  You must edit
the ChangeLog files directly and commit them as well.

Embedded C & Safety
-------------------
As mentioned previously, you can use embedded C (raw C code) to do
things not supported by the SystemTap language.  Please do this
carefully and sparingly. Embedded C bypasses all the safety features
built into SystemTap.  Be especially careful when dereferencing
pointers.  Use the kread() macro to dereference any pointers that could
potentially be invalid.  If you're not sure, err on the side of caution.
The cost of using kread() is small compared to the cost of your tapset
inadvertently crashing a system!

Review & Submission
-------------------
All new tapsets and major changes should be reviewed "early and often"
by the SystemTap community.  You can sign up for the systemtap mailing
list at http://sources.redhat.com/systemtap/getinvolved.html.  The
mailing list archive is found at http://sources.redhat.com/ml/systemtap/.
The systemtap-cvs mailing list archive is at
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/systemtap-cvs/.

You can request GIT write access at
