.SH NAME
stapfuncs \- systemtap functions

.SH DESCRIPTION
The following sections enumerate the public functions provided by
standard tapsets installed under @prefix@/share/systemtap/tapset.  Each
function is described with a signature, and its behavior/restrictions.
The signature line includes the name of the function, the type of
its return value (if any), and the names and types of all parameters.
The syntax is the same as printed with the 
.IR stap " option " \-p2 .
Examples:

.TP
example1:long (v:string, k:long)
In function "example1", do something with the given string and integer.
Return some integer.

.TP
example2:unknown ()
In function "example2", do something.  There is no explicit return value
and take no parameters.

.SS PRINTING

.TP
log:unknown (msg:string)
Writes the given string to the common trace buffer.  Append an implicit
end-of-line. Deprecated.  Please use the faster print functions.

.TP
warn:unknown (msg:string)
Write the given string to the warning stream.  Append an implicit end-of-line.
.I staprun
prepends the string "WARNING:". 

.TP
error:unknown (msg:string)
An error has occurred.  Write the given string to the error stream.
Append an implicit end-of-line.
.I staprun
prepends the string "ERROR:".
Block any further execution of statements in this probe.  If the number
of errors so far exceeds the MAXERRORS parameter, also trigger an 
.IR exit() .

.TP
exit:unknown ()
Enqueue a request to shut down the systemtap session.  This does
.B not
unwind the current probe handler, nor block new probe handlers.
.I staprun
will shortly respond to the request and initiate an orderly shutdown.

.SS CONVERSIONS
.PP
These functions access kernel or user-space data.  They try to validate the
supplied addresses, and can thus result in errors if the pointers are invalid,
or if a user-space access would cause a fault.
.TP
kernel_string:string (addr:long)
Copy a 0-terminated string from kernel space at given address.
.TP
kernel_string_n:string (addr:long, n:long)
Similar with kernel_string, except that not more than n bytes are copied.
Thus, if there are null bytes among the first n bytes, it is same as
kernel_string(addr). If not, n bytes will be copied and a null byte will
be padded to the end.
.TP
kernel_long:long (addr:long)
Copy a long from kernel space at given address.
.TP
kernel_int:long (addr:long)
Copy an int from kernel space at given address.

.TP
kernel_char:long (addr:long)
Copy a char from kernel space at given address.
.TP
user_string:string (addr:long)
Copy a string from user space at given address.  If the access would
fault, return "<unknown>" and signal no errors.
.TP
user_string2:string (addr:long, err_msg:string)
Copy a string from user space at given address.  If the access would
fault, return instead the err_msg value.
.TP
user_string_warn:string (addr:long)
Copy a string from user space at given address.  If the access would
fault, signal a warning and return "<unknown>".
.TP
user_string_quoted:string (addr:long)
Copy a string from user space at given address. Any ASCII characters
that are not printable are replaced by the corresponding escape
sequence in the returned string.
.TP
user_string_n:string (addr:long, n:long)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. If the access
would fault, return "<unknown>".
.TP
user_string_n2:string (addr:long, n:long, err_msg:string)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. If the access
would fault, return the err_msg value.
.TP
user_string_n_warn:string (addr:long, n:long)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. If the access
would fault, signal a warning and return "<unknown>".
.TP
user_string_n_quoted:string (addr:long, n:long)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. Any ASCII
characters that are not printable are replaced by the corresponding escape
sequence in the returned string. If the access would fault, return "<unknown>".

Copy an int from user space at given address. If the access would fault,
signal a warning and return 0.
.TP
user_long:long (addr:long)
Copy a long from user space at given address. If the access would fault,
return 0.
.TP
user_long_warn:long (addr:long)
Copy a long from user space at given address. If the access would fault,
signal a warning and return 0.
.TP
user_char:long (addr:long)
Copy a char from user space at given address. If the access would fault,
return 0.
.TP

string cannot be converted.
.TP
tokenize:string (str:string, delim:string)
Return the next token in the given str string, where the tokens are delimited
by one of the characters in the delim string.  If the str string is not blank,
it returns the first token.  If the str string is blank, it returns the next

.SS QUEUE_STATS
.PP
The queue_stats tapset provides functions that, given notifications of
elementary queuing events (wait, run, done), tracks averages such as
queue length, service and wait times, utilization.  The following
three functions should be called from appropriate probes, in sequence.
.TP
qs_wait:unknown (qname:string)

being serviced.
.\" XXX: qs_time
.PP
Functions with the prefix 
.BR qsq_
are for querying the statistics averaged since the first queue operation
(or when
.BR qsq_start
was called). Since statistics are often fractional, a scale parameter
is multiplies the result to a more useful scale.  For some fractions,
a scale of 100 will usefully return percentage numbers.

anew from this moment.

Return the average rate of requests per scale units of time.

The indent tapset provides functions to generate indented lines for
nested kinds of trace messages.  Each line contains a relative
timestamp, and the process name / pid.
.TP

Return a string with an appropriate indentation for this thread.
Call it with a small positive or matching negative delta.
If this is the outermost, initial level of indentation, reset the
